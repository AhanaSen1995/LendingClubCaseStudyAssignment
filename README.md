## General Information
A company who is the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing of medical procedures  faces two types of risk:
Applicants who are likely to repay the loan, not approving the loan for them results in a loss of business to the company
Applicants who are not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, approving the loan for them leads to a financial loss for the company

the company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.  The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.
